  	<h1>Game Play</h1>
  	<p>There are several features available to you during gameplay</p>
  	<ol>
  		<li>Reset allows you to reset the question. Use this when you are stuck or want a new challenge</li>
  		<li>Remove Last Item will remove the most recently added image</li>
  		<li>The various shapes at the bottom can be scrolled from left to right. Tap on one to add to your current response</li>
  	</ol>

	<h1>Completion</h1>
	<p>If you line the correct shapes in the right order, you will see a new screen appear, showing the completed image. After several seconds, this goes away and a new question appears.</p>

	<h1>Goal</h1>
	<p>There is no end point for the questions, so you can do 2,3, 20 or 200. Just stop when you want.</p>
